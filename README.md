# just getting started

Hi everybody. Today is the first day of 2020 and, as a New Year (and New Decade, btw) resolution, I've decided I'll become a programmer proficient in Python. I'm going to make it my job, and my vocation.

I have no prior experience in coding - not only with Python, in general nor in using GitHub, but I'm confident I'll acquire both with time and persistence.

Exiceted to be onboard and loking forward to starting this amazing, life-changing journey!
